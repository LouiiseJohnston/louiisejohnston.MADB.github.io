<h1>CAUSES</h1>
<div class="causes-sub">
Learn about some of the main causes of the digital divide:
</div>

<div class="main">

    <h2><u>THE LACK OF DIGITAL LITERACY</u></h2>
    <h3>Digital literacy is an individual's ability to find, evaluate, and communicate information using typing or digital media platforms.</h3>
    <img src="digitalliteracy.jpg" alt="Digital Literacy" style="height:400px">
    
    <h4><b>Lack of Education on Detecting Bias</b></h4>
	<p>Many students haven’t been taught how to detect biased information online. As a result, they may find it challenging to differentiate between biased and unbiased content, which can lead to confusion. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in fake news and conspiracy theories circulating online. Some students may find it difficult to distinguish between factual reports and sensationalised headlines, causing them to believe incorrect information. This not only impacts their understanding but could put them at risk of spreading false information to others.</p>
	<div class="fact-box">
		According to Ofcom, in their 2018 report on children and media use, half of 12 to 15-year-olds using social media for news found it difficult to discern the accuracy of news on these platforms, indicating an emerging understanding among these children of the importance of critical thinking when consuming news via social media; additionally, 36% said they frequently consider the accuracy of news stories on social media, while 53% do this occasionally.

	</div>
    <h4><b>Online Risks for Students</b></h4>
	<p>Students who lack sufficient knowledge of digital literacy, may unknowingly engage with misleading or harmful content online. This can affect their understanding of important issues and put them at risk of falling victim to scams or spreading false information. Poor digital literacy skills can hinger students’ ability to fully participate in online learning environments, collaborate with peers, and access educational resources. They may find difficulty navigating digital tolls, interpreting multimedia content, and completing assignments, which can result in missed opportunities for academic growth and socialisation.</p>
	    
    <br>
    
    <h2><u>THE LACK OF INTERNET ACCESS</u></h2>
    <h3>Internet access is the process of connecting to the Internet. Using personal computers, laptops or mobile devices by users or enterprises.</h3>
    <img src="nointernetaccess.jpg" alt="No Internet Access" style="height:300px">
 
 	<h4><b>Barriers to Learning</b></h4>
 		<p>Without access to the internet or digital devices, students faced barriers to participating in online classes, accessing educational resources, and completing assignments. This unequal access to technology widened the digital divide and negatively affected students' ability to continue learning effectively.</p>
 	<div class="fact-box">
 		According to the Children's Media Use and Attitudes Report 2023 by Ofcom, data from their Technology Tracker indicates that 97% of households with children aged 0-18 had home internet access, significantly exceeding the general average of 93%; however, this still implies that 3% of households with children in this age group did not have home internet access.

 	</div>
 	<h4><b>Impact on Academic Performance</b></h4>
	<p>The lack of both internet access and digital devices could negatively affect students’ academic performance and diminish their ability to keep pace with their peers. This unequal distribution of technology has further widened the existing inequalities in education, particularly students from underserved communities. Due to a lack of internet access, students are unable to join online classes, access educational materials or complete assignments. This puts these students at a significant disadvantage, making it harder for them to keep up with their studies and improve and/or maintain their grades. Furthermore, the failure to have access to technology has also obstructed students ability to interact with their teachers and classmates, resulting in further isolation from the educational community.</p>

	<br>
	
	<h2><u>THE LACK OF DIGITAL RESOURCES</u></h2>
    <h3>Digital resources is any type of information or media that is stored or transmitted in a digital format, such as on a computer or the internet.</h3>
    <img src="digitalresources.jpg" alt="Digital Resources" style="height:400px">
    
   	<h4><b>Limited Access to Digital Technology</b></h4>
   		<p>Some students don't have digital technology because they are unable to afford it. Without this technology, they can't take part in online classes or use digital resources for their studies, making it challenging for them to keep up with schoolwork and prepare for tasks such as college applications, which are often completed online.
   	<div class="fact-box">
   		According to the charity Children North East and the Child Poverty Action Group, a survey conducted jointly among 1,570 parents and 785 children revealed that 35% of low-income families did not possess the necessary home learning equipment, with devices like laptops or tablets being the most common need during the last lockdown.

   </div>
   	<h4><b>Difficulty Communicating and Staying Connected</b></h4>
   		<p>It can be difficult to communicate and stay connected with others without digital resources. Students who don't have access to popular social media apps might find it challenging to stay in touch with their peers and miss out on current trends and stories. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation. A lack of digital resources puts students at a disadvantage both socially and educationally. As they may struggle to keep up with their peers in school and feel left out of online conversations and educational activities.</p>
